## Project 8 - Day 8: Understanding why structured output is essential for LLM integration into software.
Focus on ensuring the LLM's output is predictable and machine-readable, a necessity for integrating LLMs into any software pipeline.

## Project 9 - Day 9: Day 9 continues structured output work by introducing output constraining beyond JSON: controlling length, format, and "no extra text" behaviors.
Apply max_tokens to constrain output length and control costs.
Design prompts that enforce strict formatting (single word, fixed paragraphs, no explanation).
Understand why grammar-based constraining exists and when prompt-only constraints fail.
